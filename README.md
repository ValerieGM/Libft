# Libft

This aim of the project is to build on concepts learnt in the C Bootcamp used for admission, to code a C Library regrouping usual functions that we will then be allowed to use in all other projects. Seeing as we do not have access to those highly useful standard functions, we have to re-code them so as to understand their usage going forth.

### Requirements

-gcc compiler

### Compiling

#### Run the following commands:
* To compile
    * make
* To remove objects:
    * make clean
* To remove objects and binary file:
    * make fclean
* To re-compile:
    * make re

### Executing

* Clone/download the repository
* cd src/
* Compile the library
* Run program:
    * e.g: 
      * ./test libft.a
